## CanteenBuddy

**CanteenBuddy** is a smart food ordering system designed to streamline the process of managing food orders in school cafeterias. By using an open-source microcontroller like the ESP32, CanteenBuddy helps reduce wait times, minimize errors, and enhance the overall dining experience for students while making the workflow easier for cafeteria workers.

### Features

- **Student Order Page**: An easy-to-use web interface where students can view the menu and place their orders.
- **Cafeteria Worker Dashboard**: A real-time dashboard for cafeteria workers to manage and update food orders.
- **Real-Time Updates**: An ESP32 microcontroller with an LCD screen to display the status of orders.
- **Notifications**: Automated notifications to inform students when their food is ready for pickup.

### Components

- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Used to manage real-time updates and display order status on an LCD screen.
- **LCD Screen**: Displays the current status of food orders.
- **Web Interface**: For students to place orders and for workers to manage those orders.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CanteenBuddy.git
   cd CanteenBuddy

2. Set up the web server:
- Place the web files in your web server directory (e.g., xampp/htdocs/chumbaka).
- Import the canteen.sql file to set up the database.

3. Configure the ESP32:
- Upload the Arduino code to the ESP32.
- Ensure the ESP32 is connected to the correct Wi-Fi network (make sure the Wi-Fi does not block IP address).

4. Modify the configuration:
- Update the ESP32 IP address in the PHP files.

### Usage
1. Students: Visit the student order page, view the menu, and place an order.
2. Cafeteria Workers: Use the worker dashboard to view incoming orders and update their status.
3. Real-Time Updates: The ESP32 will display the status of orders on the LCD screen, and students will receive notifications when their order is ready.
